### 🔗 Core Components
**[👄 Vibe Coding Translator (App)](https://soluneai.com/vibe-coding-translator/)** | **[📄 Instruction Engine (Repo)](https://github.com/solune-lab/vibe-coding-translator)** | **[🧩 Glue Code Puzzles](https://buy.stripe.com/bJebJ31MZftmaZTfsg63K00)**

### 🚀 Quick Start
1. **[Get the Rules here](https://github.com/solune-lab/the-vibe-stack/blob/main/VIBE-CODING-RULES.md)** (Copy or Download the `VIBE-CODING-RULES.md` file).
2. **For Claude Code**: Place it in `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` (global, works across all projects) or your project root `CLAUDE.md` (project-specific only).
3. **For Cursor/Windsurf**: Add it to your `.cursorrules` or Project Settings.
4. Watch your agent follow strict verification gates before every delivery.

I built this system to solve my own **"Development Constipation."**

I’m a Vibe Coder, and I’m extremely frugal with my AI quota—which also makes me very anxious. In the past, when I used natural language to give instructions, I constantly ran into bizarre situations.

For example: I just wanted to move two components closer together and reduce the white space. It was such a simple instruction. Yet, even using the most powerful coding models, the UI wouldn't budge after 5 or 6 attempts. Worse, it would randomly mess up the shapes of my components, leaving me with a pile of "spaghetti code."

This communication gap led to more and more unexpected bugs, vanishing my quota in less than 30 minutes due to endless, pointless revisions. It was beyond belief.

This pipeline isn't about showing off. It’s a **survival kit** I organized to stay within my budget limits. It turned my messy thoughts into a smooth, stable development process and cured my anxiety about token consumption. (True story.)

## 🌈 Compatibility: Works with ALL AI Tools
This system is **completely Tool-Agnostic**. While it delivers 10x efficiency for **Claude Code**, the MD rules and logic puzzles work flawlessly with **EVERY AI coding tool**, including:
* **Cursor / Windsurf / Trae**
* **Bolt.new / Lovable / Replit**
* **GitHub Copilot / Codex**
* **Any AI Agent** that accepts custom instructions or project context.

It’s about the **Logic**, not just the tool.

## 🗺️ Roadmap
This is the complete path I built to save my own development process. Every phase is designed to make the journey stable and frictionless.

* [✅] **Phase 1: Brain (Vibe Coding Rules)** – Specialized Instruction Sets that elevate AI Agents to Senior Engineers. (Released!)
* [✅] **Phase 2: Nerve (🧩 20+ Verified Glue Code Puzzles)** – Pre-verified modular templates to avoid coding from scratch. [Get Puzzles & Lifetime Updates](https://buy.stripe.com/bJebJ31MZftmaZTfsg63K00) (Released!)
* [✅] **Phase 3: Mouth (Vibe Coding Translator)** – The precision bridge that converts
